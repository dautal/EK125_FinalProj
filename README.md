The main idea behind this project was to find a way to analyze a data set with 800,000 data points, which contains almost each country's  temperature values month by month, for the last century and a half. Ten countries with different climates were chosen. The temperatures of the coldest month (January) and the hottest month (July) were picked and plotted, then analyzed using Matlab's Machine Learning tool.
