## EK125 Final Project
The main idea behind this project was to find a way to analyze a data set with 800,000 data points, which contains almost each country's  temperature values month by month, for the last century and a half. Six countries with different climates were chosen. The temperatures of the coldest month (January) and the hottest month (July) were picked and plotted, then analyzed using Matlab's Regression Learning tool. Also, the emissions data for each chosen country is analyzed to find out whether there is a correlation betweeen two.
